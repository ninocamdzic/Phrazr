# Phrazr
Phrazr is a tool which uses Microsoft Data Protection API (DPAPI) to protect a passphrase and store it in the registry. The stored passphrase can later be retrieved to be used in other applications. This can only be done with the same user which was used to protect the passphrase.

## How does it work?
1. Determine the user which will be able to store and retrieve the password.
2. Run `Phrazr.exe` as the determined user and save a passphrase in the registry.
3. Configurate your application to run as the determined user.
4. Use `Phrazrg.exe` to retrieve the passphrase (See *Retrieving Passphrase* for more details).

## Real world scenario
**Decrypting private keys on Apache HTTP webserver startup**: When using encrypted private keys, Apache HTTP needs some way to retrieve the passphrase to be able to decrypt the private key. The `mod_ssl` module provides the `SSLPassphraseDialog` directive which can be used to call an external process to retrieve the passphrase.

## Retrieving the passphrase
Keeping in mind the above real world scenario, you want to make sure that you call Phrazrg with a user which can actually retrieve the passphrase. This means that Apache HTTP must run as the same user which stored the passphrase. When `SSLPassphraseDialog` runs Phrazrg, it will use the same user.
```
SSLPassPhraseDialog "c:/tools/phrazr/mypass.exe"
```
Suppose we have a passphrase stored in a key called `mypass`. To retrieve the passphrase we rename `Phrazrg.exe` to `mypass.exe`. Phrazrg now knows which key to retrieve. Do not use spaces in key names. See Known Issues for

**Side note**: Phrazr stores all keys under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Phrazr`.

## Known Issues

For some reason `SSLPassphraseDialog` interprets the result retrieved by Phrazrg as having a line ending. This results in the retrieved passphrase being wrong. To fix this, we can create a separate batch file(call it mypass.bat), where we call Phrazrg like so:

```
@echo off
mypass.exe
```

Put the batch file in the same directory as Phrazrg and change your `SSLPassPhraseDialog` line to:

```
SSLPassPhraseDialog "c:/tools/phrazr/mypass.bat"
```

I haven't looked too far into the issue but `@echo off` seems to solve line ending issue.
